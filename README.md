# PDF-reader-text-to-speech-eng
This Python code uses PyPDF2 and pyttsx3 libraries to read text from PDF files aloud in English. It extracts text from the file, converts it to speech using the text-to-speech engine, and sets the rate and volume of the speech. The user can listen to the content instead of reading it visually.
